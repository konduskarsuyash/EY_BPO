You are given a list of customer complaint descriptions and their corresponding Ticket IDs. 
Your task is to determine how many complaints are similar to the reference one in the list and identify the Ticket ID of the first similar complaint.

Instructions:
1. This complaint description: {current_complain} will be the reference complaint.
2. Compare each of the previous complaints to the reference and assess their similarity.
3. A complaint is considered similar if it describes the same issue (e.g., slow network, poor service, etc.), uses a similar problem-solving approach, or faces similar challenges.
4. Focus on the general meaning and nature of the problem, not the exact wording or phrasing.
5. Identify the Ticket ID of the *first complaint* that is similar to the reference complaint.
6. If no complaints are similar to this complaint: {current_complain}:
   - Return a count of 0.
   - Return the Ticket ID as {ticket_id_generated}.

Output format: 
<Count of similar complaints>,<Ticket ID>
(e.g., "3,TICKET1234" or "0,LASTTICKET1234")
